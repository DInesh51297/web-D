  <h2>This is My first Article </h2>

  <p class="quote">A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of many sentences. They are usually between four to eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out</p>

 <p>In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.And then starting again; this makes telling when one paragraph ends and another begins easier. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay
